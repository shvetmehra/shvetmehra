Shvet Mehra |HR Manager & AI Technologist Strategic HRBP | OCI Certified AI Professional | Six Sigma Blackbelt

Strategic Overview With over 20+ years of transformative experience in HR operations and systems, I am a results-driven leader specializing in the intersection of human capital strategy and cutting-edge technology. Currently serving as a Senior HRIS Analyst at Oracle Financial Services Software Ltd.,. My career is defined by a unique ability to bridge the gap between functional HR business partnering (HRBP) and technical data science to drive organizational productivity and revenue growth.

Technical Expertise & Innovation I am a Certified Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) 2025 AI & Data Science Professional, specializing in Generative AI, AI Vector Search, and Predictive Modeling. I leverage a sophisticated technical stack—including Python, R-programming, and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)—to automate high-scale HR workflows and provide deep-dive predictive analytics for critical metrics like turnover and attrition. I recently led a global reporting transition project that achieved a 47.6% optimization by eliminating data redundancies through automated logic.

Operational Leadership & Impact My operational background includes end-to-end management of large-scale employee benefit portfolios, including Group Medical (GMC), Personal Accident (GPA), Term Life (GTL), and Outpatient (OPD) coverage for Oracle India and its subsidiaries. As a Six Sigma Blackbelt, I apply lean methodologies to refine HR processes. Notable achievements include reducing employee exit clearance times by 17.6% (from 34 to 28 days) and decreasing query reassignment rates by 41.2% through workflow re-engineering.

Strategic Partnering & Change Management Beyond systems, I act as a strategic liaison for business leaders, translating data-driven insights into actionable talent management and retention tactics. My role as a Change Management Lead ensures that technical transitions—such as the implementation of ad-hoc HR applications or automated systems—are seamlessly aligned with organizational culture and stakeholder needs.
